SAMM 
===


Shared apartment money manager

##What

SAMM is a PHP Web-app which supposed to handle your complex finance situation you may run into when living in a shared apartment.

##Installation

Samm is not done yet, so no installation I'm afraid

##How it works

Every inmate has its own accoutn from which he can post his expenses SAMM takes up on the math and solves who has to pay whom. At giving time everyone (with an account) can see a rundown of who spent how much on what. At the end of the month SAMM tells you who has to to how much compensation to whom. That's it. It's jsut that easy. No more paperslips with internal debts. Just a simple Web-App to keep track of your money.
